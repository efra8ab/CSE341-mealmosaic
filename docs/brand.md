# Meal Mosaic UI Notes

- Landing page: gradient background (slate navy), glassy card, bright accent buttons (mint + blue).
- Typography: Inter/system, bold headline, chips for tech stack callouts.
- Primary actions: “Open API Docs”, “Login with GitHub”, “Check Session”.
- Keep visuals lightweight (no extra assets) to avoid runtime impact on the API.
